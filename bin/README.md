# Binaries

This directory contains some compiled binaries, among other for the FieldTrip buffer and for the openbci2ft application. These binaries are maintained as part of the [FieldTrip](https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip) project. Running the `install.sh` script will determine your platform and download the required binaries. This only needs to be done once upon initial installation.

This directory also contains the `parallel` Bash script, which is used to start FieldTrip buffers in parallel.
