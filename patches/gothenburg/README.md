# Gothenburg patch

This directory contains the patches for the February 2019 performance in Gothenburg.

The EEG goes into the spectral module and then into the `historycontrol` module to construct a well-behaved and slowly changing control signal. Using the `outputcvgate` module, that control signal is converted into a voltage that goes into the analog synthesizer.

There are three videos (A, B and C) that fade into each other. The mix is controlled by a single brain control signal, which goes through the `geomixer` module to map it onto three channels for each A, B and C. The AVmixer software has "mixer 1" that controls the balance between A and B, and "mixer 2" that controls the balance between the A+B and the C mix. The `postprocessing` module is used to map the three channels from the `geomixer` onto the two hierarchical mixer channels, which are transmitted by `outputmidi` to the AVmixer software.

The progress of the performance is tracked with a Neopixel array that slowly fills up from 0% to 100%. The patch for this consists of a very low frequency sawtooth generated by the `generatecontrol` module that feeds into the `outputartnet` module.

## Graphical representation

The following visualizes the relation between the modules. The `redis` module is not displayed explicitly but is omnipresent, since most communication between modules goes over Redis.

## Launchcontrol

We are using the Novation Launchcontrol XL and the `launchcontrol` module to start/pause/restart certain features and to make live parameter adjustments. Below is a schematic representation of the MIDI controls and notes.
